title: "About Me"
description: "From building my first API in a basement to helping teams worldwide create developer tools that don't suck—here's my story."

content: |
  I'm Steve McDougall, and I've been obsessing over APIs and developer experience for over a decade.
  It started with a simple frustration: why were so many developer tools painful to use? Why did documentation assume you already knew everything? Why did APIs that worked perfectly in demos break the moment you tried to build something real?
  These questions led me down a path from backend development to developer relations, from writing code to writing about code, from building tools to helping others build better tools.

  ## The Journey

  - **Early Days**: Cut my teeth building APIs in PHP, learning the hard way that technical perfection means nothing if developers can't figure out how to use what you've built.
  - **The Teaching Bug**: Started writing tutorials and speaking at meetups because I wanted to share what I'd learned. Discovered I loved helping other developers have those "aha!" moments.
  - **Going Deeper**: Joined the PHP-FIG core committee to help shape language standards. Realized that the best tools come from community collaboration, not ivory tower decisions.
  - **The Consultant Chapter**: Now I help teams worldwide design APIs, scale developer programs, and create content that actually moves the needle.

  ## What Drives Me

  I believe developer experience is a competitive advantage that most companies completely underestimate. The difference between an API that developers tolerate and one they actively recommend is usually not technical—it's about understanding and empathy.
  Every project I take on is guided by one question: _"Will this make a developer's day better or worse?"_

  ## How I Can Help

  - **API Strategy**: Design developer-first APIs that scale with your business
  - **DevRel Programs**: Build content and community strategies that drive real adoption  
  - **Technical Leadership**: Guide architectural decisions and mentor growing teams
  - **Content Creation**: Turn complex technical concepts into clear, actionable guidance

  ## Beyond Work

  When I'm not consulting, I'm usually:
  - Contributing to open-source projects that solve real problems
  - Writing for PHP Architect or creating YouTube tutorials
  - Speaking at conferences about API design and developer experience
  - Tinkering with new tools and technologies (currently exploring Go and Zig)

  ## Let's Connect

  I love meeting fellow developers, founders, and anyone passionate about building great tools. Whether you're looking for help with a specific project or just want to chat about the state of developer tooling, I'm always up for a conversation.
