  I'm Steve McDougall — an API strategist, DevRel consultant, and backend developer who helps engineering teams build better tools for other developers.

  With over a decade of experience in backend development, developer relations, and platform strategy, I help tech teams bridge the gap between what they build and how developers use it.

  I blend deep technical experience with clear communication — so the stuff your team ships doesn’t just work, it lands.

  Whether you’re launching a new API, scaling your DevRel efforts, or improving developer onboarding—I bring the code, content, and clarity to make it happen.

  ### My Superpowers

  - **API Architecture & Strategy**
  - **Developer Experience Design**
  - **Developer Relations & Community Building**
  - **Technical Content Creation**
  - **Engineering Leadership**

  ### On a mission to improve API education.

  There's more to me than my day job. In my spare time I also like to write articles for publications such as Laravel News, or PHP Architect, as well as maintaining my own YouTube channel. When not doing this, I can be found contributing to open-source or speaking at conferences around the world.

  ### My Philosophy

  It's all about bridging technology with community. I believe in empowering developers, fostering collaborative learning, and creating supportive spaces for everyone who's passionate about tech. For me, learning is a lifelong journey, and there's nothing better than sharing what you know with others.
