  title: "About Me"
  description: |
    I'm Steve McDougall â€” a developer, DevRel consultant, and content strategist. I work with engineering-led teams to sharpen their developer experience, scale community engagement, and build tools developers actually want to use.
    I design APIs, build content ecosystems, and lead DevRel programs that make products easier to adopt, scale, and love.
